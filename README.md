# BitSong JS Key Offline Generator

This tool helps you generating a new random seed and address. The tool uses the Mainnet _HDPATH_ `44'/639'/0'/0/`

# Important

DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE IN A SECURE PLACE YOUR MNEMONONIC PHRASE.

No one - not a bank, family member, or BitSong - can access your crypto if it's in a wallet, unless they have the seed phrase.

Your seed phrase acts as the key to your wallet. You must store it somewhere secure, such as a password manager.
